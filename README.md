# IoT-UK-Nation-Database-APIs

The organisation end point can be accessed here:  [url to be confirmed].

The end point allows you to filter the IoT UK Nation database by the following fields:
 - Organisation postcode  (using `postcode=`)
 - Organisation town (using `town=`)
 - Organisation sic code (using `sic=`)
 - Organisation founding year (using `year=`)
 - Organisation NUTS region (using `nuts=`)
 
You may chain together these filters in any order and in any combination.

For example, you may wish to filter the data to find organisations in Leeds which were founded in 2015.  To do this you may use the filter `town=Leeds&year=2015`.

A full copy of the organisations in the IoT UK Nation database can be downloaded from Data Mill North by visiting the link: https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/iotuk-nation-database
